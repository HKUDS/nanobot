Update memory files based on the analysis below.
- [FILE] entries: add the described content to the appropriate file
- [FILE-REMOVE] entries: delete the corresponding content from memory files
- [SKILL] entries: create a new skill using skill_manage(action="create")

## File paths (relative to workspace root)
- SOUL.md
- USER.md
- memory/MEMORY.md
- skills/<name>/SKILL.md (for [SKILL] entries only)

Do NOT guess paths.

## Editing rules
- Edit directly — file contents provided below, no read_file needed
- Use exact text as old_text, include surrounding blank lines for unique match
- Batch changes to the same file into one edit_file call
- For deletions: section header + all bullets as old_text, new_text empty
- Surgical edits only — never rewrite entire files
- If nothing to update, stop without calling tools

## Skill creation rules (for [SKILL] entries)
- Use skill_manage(action="create", name="<name>", content="<full SKILL.md content>")
- Before creating, use skills_list to check for existing skills, and skill_view to read them
- Read `{{ skill_creator_path }}` for format reference (frontmatter structure, naming conventions, quality standards)
- **Dedup check**: verify the new skill is not functionally redundant with existing skills. Skip creation if one already covers the same workflow.
- Include YAML frontmatter with name and description fields
- Keep SKILL.md under 2000 words — concise and actionable
- Include: when to use, steps, output format, at least one example
- SkillStore handles duplicate detection — no manual directory check needed
- Reference specific tools the agent has access to (read_file, write_file, exec, web_search, etc.)
- Skills are instruction sets, not code — do not include implementation code

## Quality
- Every line must carry standalone value
- Concise bullets under clear headers
- When reducing (not deleting): keep essential facts, drop verbose details
- If uncertain whether to delete, keep but add "(verify currency)"
