"""Filesystem-level defense for files only ``MemoryStore`` should write.

The shell-command guard (``nanobot.security.network.contains_internal_url``
and the ``_PROTECTED_TARGET_RE`` in ``agent/tools/shell.py``) is a heuristic:
regex on raw shell text cannot cover every expansion trick. Once a
compromised ``bash -c`` actually issues ``open(…, "w")`` on the canonical
resolved path, the kernel is the only layer left.

This module keeps the protected files at mode ``0o444`` so a write through
``bash -c "tee … / … .jsonl"`` — however cleverly the attacker split the
filename to bypass the regex — fails with ``EACCES``. ``MemoryStore`` wraps
its own writes in :func:`writable` to briefly flip the mode for a legitimate
internal update.

Residual risk: an attacker that can write in the parent directory can still
``rm`` and recreate the file. That requires a second bypass (the directory
write guard) and is left to a follow-up.
