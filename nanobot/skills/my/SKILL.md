# Self-Awareness

## How to use

1. **Identify the situation** from the categories below
2. **Call the my tool** with the appropriate action
3. **If set**, warn the user before changing impactful settings (model, iterations)
4. **For detailed examples**, read [references/examples.md](references/examples.md)

## When to check

<rule>
**Diagnose before explaining.** When something doesn't work, check your state first.
</rule>

<rule>
**Check budget before complex tasks.** Know your limits before committing.
</rule>

<rule>
**Recall across turns.** Store preferences in your scratchpad, read them back later.
</rule>

## When to set

<rule>
**Only set when benefit is clear and user is informed.** Warn before changing model.
</rule>

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Large codebase analysis | `my(action="set", key="context_window_tokens", value=262144)` |
| Switch to a named model preset | `my(action="set", key="model_preset", value="<preset-name>")` |
| Repetitive simple tasks without a preset | `my(action="set", key="model", value="<fast-model>")` |
| Long multi-step task | `my(action="set", key="max_iterations", value=80)` |

**Tradeoff:** Bias toward stability. Only set when defaults are genuinely insufficient.

## Anti-patterns

<rule>
**Don't check every turn.** Costs a tool call. Use when you need information, not reflexively.
</rule>

<rule>
**Don't store sensitive data.** No API keys, passwords, or tokens in scratchpad.
</rule>

<rule>
**Don't set workspace.** Does not update file tool boundaries — won't work.
</rule>

## Constraints

- All modifications in-memory only — restart resets everything
- Prefer `model_preset` for configured model choices. Direct `model` changes clear the active preset and should only be used when no preset exists.
- Protected params have type/range validation: `max_iterations` (1–100), `context_window_tokens` (4096–1M), `model` (non-empty str)
- If `tools.my.allow_set` is false, check only

| Need | Use | Persists? |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Per-session temp state | `my(action="set", key="...", value=...)` | No |
| Long-term facts | Memory skill (`MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`) | Yes |
| Permanent config change | Edit config file | Yes |

**Rule of thumb:** Tomorrow? Memory. This turn only? My.
